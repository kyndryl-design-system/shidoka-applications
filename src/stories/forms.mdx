# Forms

Example form using our custom input components.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={FormsStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

## Form Participation

Our custom input components are coded to be associated with forms so their values are included in [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData), which can be captured from the `submit` event of the `<form>` element.

### Example

```js
document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const formData = new FormData(e.target);
});
```
